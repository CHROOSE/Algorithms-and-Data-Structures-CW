Uses of Arrays: 

I used an array type data structure to store the objects placed on the board of the game.  

As the board will always be a fixed size and fast access to a specific board space may be needed to modify the data stored there.  

For example, the user clicks an empty board space and the array element representing it needs to be changed from empty to full.
